# Welcome to Pandora's Box

> Insert some deep and meaningful quote from an arbitrary human talking about the importance of learning

As developers, constantly upskilling is a part of our career. It's understandably hard though because there is so much that is ALWAYS going on, so how do you learn what you need to learn and find good sources to learn it? I've spent a lot of hours scrolling through articles trying to find good sources for helping me learn things with no avail.

This, is where Pandora's Box comes in. The goal of this repository is to build a knowledge base for all developers to learn about the things that matter. It won't be all inclusive, but it should be a good starting point especially for the beginners.
