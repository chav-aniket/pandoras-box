# Lecture 3: Moral Reasoning & Professional Ethics

In this lecture Stephen Cohen discusses a variety of topics on the factors in making ethical decisions and what perspectives we can look at in order to inform the decisions that we may come across.

## Barriers to ethical decisions:

- partisanship
  - working in the best interest of the client
  - becoming bias to the client's potentially wrongheaded interests
  - close relationship to client causes you to lose objectivity
- rationalisation
  - creating a narrative which excuses taking an action with your own interest put ahead of your client's
- implicit bias
  - unconsciously substituting real knowledge with personally held stereotypes, opinions and motivations which may not align with the client
- ethical blindness
  - failing to see an ethical issue
  - can be temporary or permanent
    - temporary through mental/physical exhaustion
    - temporary through narrowed scope of focus
- reasoning with false equivalency
  - if it's legal, then it's acceptable and so a moral action

Cohen first goes through the barriers to ethical decisions. Here, partisanship is where you are working in the best interest of the client and can become bias to the client's potentially wrongheaded interests. Your close relationship to the client may cause you to lose objectivity which can affect your ability to make ethical decisions. Rationalisation is where you create narratives which excuse taking an action with your own interest put ahead of a client's. Implicit bias deals with unconsciously substituting real knowledge with personally held stereotypes, opinions and motivations which may not align with the client. Similarly ethical blindness is the inability to even see the ethical issue at all, which could be temporary or permanent. Finally, we have reasoning with false equivalency which says that if something is allowed then it is a condoned and thus an ethical action. These barriers must be learnt in order to identify them after which we can take actions to overcome them.

## Ford Pinto

- Marketed from 1971 till 1980
- ranked by numerous lists to be "one of the 10 cars that deserved to fail"
- "2000, 2000" - no more than $2000 and weighs no more than 2000 pounds
- Ready in no more than 25 months as opposed to the standard 43
- Product objectives: size, weight, price, fuel consumption, reliability, appearance, comfort, features, ride and handling
- "Safety doesn't sell" Lee Iaococca (President of Ford Motor Company)
- "This company is run by salesman, not engineers" Anon Ford Engineer
- car was confirmed to explode in minor accidents due to a bolt in the trunk which upon collision would puncture the fuel tank, but trunk space mattered more than safety
- they analysed the savings of fixing the security and the cost of fixing it and realised the cost was 150% of the projected savings
- they did not consider the reputation cost

Cohen gives us an unfortunate case study from the Ford Motor Company with their Ford Pinto (1971-1980). This car was developed to be lighter, cheaper and quicker to manufacture than other cars. In doing this, the car had a dire engineering flaw where if the rear of the car was collided into, there was a bolt in the trunk which could be pushed and would consequently puncture the fuel tank, leading to an explosion. This was a known engineering flaw which Ford Motors chose to ignore as they did not consider safety to be an objective of their product. They calculated the costs they would incur from deaths, burn injuries and burnt cars caused by the flaw to be only 36% of the cost it would take for them to fix the flaw and thus chose to ignore it. Ford shows rationalisation and reasoning with false equivalency here with their excuse that cars need only be covered for safe crashes at 20 mph where the pinto had a ruptured fuel tank for every crash at over 25 mph. There is also an abundance of just ethical blindness within the company as noted by the anonymous engineer who said "This company is run by salesman, not engineers".

## Breaking Norms

- exceptions to the rule
  - a special case with a special interaction to the general rule
- counterexample
  - a special case which goes directly against the general rule and disproves it entirely
- anomaly
  - a special case that cannot be explained by the general rule and is not currently handled

## Triangle of informing decisions

- Your decisions should be informed by ethical judgement and rules and regulations
- ethical judgement is a part of responsibility which involves proactive judgement which empower ethics
- rules and regulations are a part of accountability which emphasise defining processes, tracking progress and revealing liabilities upon these processes going wrong
- In order to convey expectations and communicate standards of behaviour in responsibility and accountability, we have codes of ethics and conduct
- A code of ethics is a set of general guidelines outlining values and methods of judgement which can empower ethical behaviour
- A code of conduct is a set of specific regulations which must be adhered and work to enforce uniformity in behaviour
- These codes are created not only communicate the behaviour and judgement expectations of employees but also to communicate these expectations to the general public and help hold the company itself accountable

In informing our decisions, Cohen now looks towards the ideas of accountability and responsibility. Ethical judgement is a part of responsibility which involves proactive judgement in empowering ethics whilst rules and regulations are a part of accountability which emphasise defining processes, tracking progress and revealing liabilities should a process go wrong. In order to convey our expectations in how accountability and responsibility should inform our decisions, we write codes of ethics and conduct. A code of ethics is a set of general guidelines outlining values and methods of judgement which can empower ethical behaviour while a code of conduct is a set of specific regulations which must be adhered to in order to enforce uniformity in behaviour. These codes are created to communicate expectations from individuals and also to communicate these expectations to the general public.

## Ethical Caution

- preventing, avoiding and minimising the unethical
- precautionary principle
  - where something is not known to be harmful for sure, it must be assumed that the action is guaranteed to be harmful
  - where something is not known to have risk for sure, it must be assumed that the action is guaranteed to have risk
- provide 'safe exits'
  - where a risk is identified, we must details procedures for what should / must be done if that risk is realised
- engaging in 'defensive driving'
  - the actions taken to prevent a risk being realised
- How do we bring all of these into a pipeline of actions / considerations?
  - William Frankena about 40 years ago
  - Don't inflict harm
  - Prevent harm
  - Remove harm
  - Do good

Now that Cohen had gone through what barriers we may encounter in making ethical actions as well as how our decisions should be informed, he tied it all together in a workflow which everyone can follow. We start with the precautionary principle where if something is not known to be harmful or to have risk for sure, then it must be assumed to be harmful or have risk for sure. We must then provide 'safe exits' where if a risk is identified, then we must detail procedures on what should / must be done if that risk is realised. Lastly we must engage in 'defensive driving' where preventative actions must be taken in order to minimise the chance of these risks / harmful events being realised. These are all summarised well by William Frankena in "Don't inflict harm. Prevent harm. Remove harm. Do good."

## Dirty Hands

- A situation where you do something right in order to make amends for something previously done wrong
- This ethical act does not erase your wrongful action, it only makes that action and by extension you more forgivable by any affected individuals
