# Week 1: Engineering as a Profession

## Aims

- Understand the responsibilities of a professional engineer
- Examine some codes of ethics/conduct that apply to the IT industry
- Develop intuitions to support ethical reasoning

### What is Engineering; What is a Profession?

> Edward, Samuel, Simar, Sahil

- What is Engineering? How is Engineering different from Science or Mathematics?
  - Science / Math is about understanding the world around us, completely theoretical
  - Engineering is about building things, far more practical with design processes
- What is a profession? What is not a profession? Give examples and explain why.
  - An occupation is doing work for remuneration
  - A profession is to adhere to a certain set of conducts which can be measured through experience or accreditation
- Is Engineering a profession (don't just believe the Wikipedia articles)?
  - Engineering itself is a field of professions but has very weak links between all avenues of engineering to be considered a profession itself
    - A product engineer or biometrics engineer would have extremely vague connections to a mechanical engineer for example
- Is Software Engineering a profession? Or, in what ways is Software Engineering a profession and in what ways is Software Engineering not a profession?
  - It requires a lot of understanding in both computer science theory as well as the current technology state to be able to work in software engineering 
- Same question but for Computer Engineering.
  - eheh
- Is Bioinformatics different from Software Engineering or not?
  - eheh
- How does Computer Science differ from Software Engineering?
  - ehe
- Is programming or "coding" the same as Software Engineering?
  - ebhe
- What are the differences in the UNSW curricula relating to these questions?

### 2. Codes of Ethics/Conduct

- What is the difference between a code of ethics and a code of conduct?

- Why do we need such codes at all? Why does ACM have two codes?

- Form into groups and compare two of the codes of ethics/conduct above.

- - Do these codes have anything particular to do with Engineering or Software Engineering, e.g. how do the codes differ from a code for medical practitioners?
  - Do the two codes have any similarities/differences?
  - What situations would count as breaches of the codes? Give some examples.
  - Have you come across activities that might be in breach of these codes?
  - How would the codes guide your actions when you might otherwise be in breach?
  - Do the codes give adequate guidance of what to do in these situations?
  - How do these codes compare to the UNSW student code?

### 3. Ethical Awareness

- Consider the particular scenarios below and ask three questions:

- - What are the ethical issues involved, if any?
  - What behaviour of whom is unethical or not unethical, and why?
  - What alternative course(s) of action should have been pursued?

- Scenarios:

- - A worm is paralysing the whole Internet. You code and send out another worm that follows in the tracks of the first worm and deletes it, restores the system to its previous state, removes itself and moves on to clean up other infected computers.
  - Your university has just signed up to a commercial online learning system where you will be able to complete online courses for credit towards your degree. All instruction and assessment will be carried out online. Your school will conduct a trial in which some students take the current course and some the online course.
  - You are the lecturer in charge/student of a course and have just received an unsolicited e-mail saying that your course has been added to a commercial "social learning" site where you can share course materials and track progress; you need to provide your CSE e-mail address and list of courses in order to register and login.
  - You are a staff member/student who has just received an e-mail from the faculty IT service stating that torrent sites will henceforth be blocked, due to the "high security risks" associated with those sites, which "expose systems and users to unacceptably high risks related to malware, copyright infringement, and provision of unauthorized access by third parties". Further, if you have legitimate requirements to access a torrent site, you must outline these requirements and obtain written approval from your Head of School.
  - You are a second year student who, just before the exam, posts your "possibly incomplete/incorrect" lab solutions to the course Facebook group. Other students memorize those solutions, but do poorly on the exam because the solutions are wrong. You answer the questions better using different lab solutions.
  - You are a (male) student in a project group and two of your (male) team members are discussing, in lewd (and lurid) terms, in a private Facebook group set up for project communication, a female student who might (or might not) join your team. When the female student does later join the team, she is added to the Facebook group and sees all the comments. Consider this question in relation to the broader issue of the university's policy on sexual harassment in light of the [Australian Human Rights Commission survey on university sexual assault](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/aug/01/university-sexual-assault-report-released-live).
  - You are a university student who falsifies a request for special consideration for an exam by photoshopping the special consideration form and filling it in with a spurious medical condition but a valid doctor's address stamp.
  - You are a university seminar coordinator about to host a speaker on trans rights when you hear of a possible student protest against the speaker whilst on campus for supposed transphobic views. You decide to cancel the seminar.
