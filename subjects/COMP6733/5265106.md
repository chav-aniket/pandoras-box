# CS6733 Problem Set

## Question 1

#### Solution: Proximity watches

We choose a Texas Instruments SimpleLink Sensortag in a wristwatch form and initiated as rpl border routers which can utilise a machine learning aided distance approximating algorithm based off RSSI values to determine whether the moving body is within 150cm of another sensortag. Upon receiving a watch, its ipv6 address can be paired with the student ID within an overarching system. 

Upon breaching the distance limit the buzzer would activate and the sensor can send a request to all watches in the area to ask for their locations, once received the watch can either take the request that arrived first or calculate which device was closest / within the 150 cm radius. 

The violation can be then forwarded within the network of watches until it reaches some base device which can upload it to a server with all violation records.

This has the cost of $59 for each sensortag plus depending on time period for use, battery costs. Battery usage can be decreased by limiting active times by potentially having swipe stations within classes where a student can "swipe in" to say they are in a supervised controlled environment and so the watch does not need to be actively searching for breaches. 

This assumes the watch is not taken off and so each student is always accountable within the network. It is ultimately not a highly effective method and something such as COVIDsafe is a better application within schools as most students ensure their phones are always charged and on.

## Question 2

An ETX between 2 nodes is calculated by $\frac{1}{ d_{f} \times d_{r} }$. For example $S \rarr b$ has $d_f=0.65$ and $d_r=0.7$ and so $\text{ETX}_{S \rarr b}=\frac{1}{0.65 \times 0.7}=2.198$. To calculate the route ETX we simply find the sum of all ETXs along that path. We use these calculated ETXs as our routing metric and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path with the lowest route ETX which gives us `S -> f -> c -> e -> D` with a total path ETX of 6.506 ($\frac{1}{(0.75^{2}) \times (0.95^{2}) \times (0.65 \times 0.75) \times (0.75 \times 0.85)}$).

## Question 3

We begin by finding the time difference in order to find out the lag of the ultrasonic behind the radio packet. We can multiply the time difference by 340 (speed of sound) to find out the distance between both nodes. 

After this we model circles with centres at the coordinates of each node and a radius of the distance calculated earlier. 

The information given and found in the steps so far can be found in the below table. 

|                 | 1                                                        | 2                                                        | 3                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordinates     | (50,70)                                                  | (20,20)                                                  | (70,30)                                                  |
| Time Difference | 0.0749                                                   | 0.0989                                                   | 0.0971                                                   |
| Distance        | 25.466                                                   | 33.626                                                   | 33.014                                                   |
| Circle Formula  | $\left(x-50\right)^{2}+\left(y-70\right)^{2}=25.466^{2}$ | $\left(x-20\right)^{2}+\left(y-20\right)^{2}=33.626^{2}$ | $\left(x-70\right)^{2}+\left(y-30\right)^{2}=33.014^{2}$ |

In order to find the point of intersection between all 3 circles, we'll expand the circles for nodes 1 and 2 first. 
$$
\left(x-50\right)^{2}+\left(y-70\right)^{2}=25.466^{2} \\
\left(x^{2}-100x+2500\right)+\left(y^{2}-140y+4900\right)=648.517 \text{ (1)}\\

\left(x-20\right)^{2}+\left(y-20\right)^{2}=33.626^{2} \\
\left(x^{2}-40x+400\right)+\left(y^{2}-40y+400\right)=1130.708 \text{ (2)}\\
$$
Now we calculate $(2) - (1)$ for the result,
$$
60x-2100+100y-4500=482.191 \\
60x+100y=7082.191\\
x=\frac{7082.191-100y}{60}
$$

We now substitute this into one of the first 2 circle equations used,
$$
\left(x-20\right)^{2}+\left(y-20\right)^{2}=33.626^{2} \\
\left(x^{2}-40x+400\right)+\left(y^{2}-40y+400\right)=1130.708 \\
\left(\frac{7082.191-100y}{60}\right)^{2}-40\left(\frac{7082.191-100y}{60}\right)+y^{2}-40y=330.708 \\
7082.191^{2}-1416438.2y+10000y^{2}-2400(7082.191-100y)+3600y^{2}-144000y=1190548.8 \\
13600y^{2}-1320438.2y+31969622.16=0
$$
Applying the quadratic formula and feeding the values back into the equation we get the following points,
$$
(33.058, 50.987) \\
(41.185, 46.113)
$$
We now substitute these into the equation $\left(x-70\right)^{2}+\left(y-30\right)^{2}=33.014^{2}$ for node 3 to see if one of these points lie on the circle and we find that $(41.185,46.113)$. These are the coordinates of the node X.
